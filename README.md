## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  Various algorithms and filters were applied to clean and enhance the dataset for improved model performance.
  
- **Noise Removal**:  
  Advanced noise removal techniques, such as Gaussian filtering and Median filtering, were used to improve image quality.

- **Deep Learning Models**:  
  State-of-the-art deep learning architectures were implemented and trained for the classification task. These include CNNs and other advanced networks.

- **Model Evaluation**:  
  The models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was selected as the final classifier.

- **Final Model**:  
  The final model integrates the preprocessing pipeline and optimized deep learning model for robust disease detection.
